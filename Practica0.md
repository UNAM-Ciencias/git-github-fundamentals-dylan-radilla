# What I learned

Although I've benn using Github for some time there where still things I didnÂ´t
fully understand about it, one of them being **Markdown files**, which Github
generates as README files whenever you create a repository, it was good to get
to know how this Files work and also that I can create my own customized README
for my Github projects, also Github explore was something I haven't got to use
as I really didn't know there was such a platform within the page, so is nice 
to know there is somewhere to look for interesting projects.
